# Blackboard-like System

## Setup
Open the folder **“Blackboard Sim”** with *IntelliJ IDEA* and run the **main class**.

## Important Information

The system is **already populated**, so if you want to try it with no data, just remove the following files:

- `Admin.bin`
- `Course.bin`
- `Student.bin`
- `Teacher.bin`

Then, log in as the **Super Admin** and start populating the system.
